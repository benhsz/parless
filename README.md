# Parsvelte
Parsvelte is the name of the DrRacket plugin that aims to implement Adaptive Code Visualization, first loosely described in this [blog post](https://benhsz.github.io/my-answer-to-the-parenthesis-problem/). 

The purpose of this feature is to improve the user experience of Lisp-like programming languages, such as Racket, Scheme, Common Lisp, etc.

## What Does It Do?
First, what it does *not* do: it makes __absolutely no changes to the syntax.__  

The programmer will type just as many opening and closing parentheses as before.  

As for what it does, it makes code look different. Here's an example:

More details and examples in the [implementation plan](steps-to-implement.md) and the above linked blog post.

## Work In Progress
Work on this hasn't begun yet, although the [implementation plan](steps-to-implement.md) describes the steps necessary to implement this feature.  

Steps completed: 0/7
